<div class="context-body">
    <p>Set a bedtime that you can consistently adhere to.</p>
    <p class="list-heading">Set a sleep-supporting routine</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Set a dinner time and reduce late-night snacking</li>
        <li>Limit tea and nightcaps to right after dinner</li>
        <li>No screens 1+ hour before bed - buy a book, a puzzle, or take up journaling before bed</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="list-heading">Set a refreshing morning routine</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Drink a full glass of water upon waking</li>
        <li>10+ minutes of meditation and/or goal management</li>
        <li>10+ minutes of sun exposure - outdoors or by a window</li>
        <li>10+ minutes of physical activity - walking, yoga, stretching</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="list-heading">Implementation (2+ weeks):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.
            Persist in this behavior until you're naturally tired at your set bed time.
            Over time, you'll start to wake up more effectively as well.
