        Following a muscle-building routine offers outsized benefits for health and longevity.
        Increased lean mass increases insulin sensitivity, improves cardiovascular fitness, and reduces all-cause mortality risks.
        Additional, significant health benefits include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Axial compression (i.e. lifting weights) has been shown to improve bone density markers as women age and reduce the rate of hip fractures.</li>
        <li>Resistance exercise has been shown to be 150% more effective than medication or cognitive behavior therapy at improving depression, stress, and anxiety symptoms.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="list-heading">Target 150+ minutes per week of exercise across both:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cardio (increasing your heart rate for extended periods of time): running, swimming, biking, rowing, HIIT, circuit training</li>
        <li>Strength Training (and hypertrophy training): weight lifting, resistance exercise, calisthenics</li>
        <!-- <li>Mobility: Yoga, static stretching, dynamic stretching, pilates</li> -->
    </ul>

    <p class="list-heading">Implementation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add 20 minutes of hypertrophy training per week, each week, to your routine until you're averaging 60+ minutes per week.</li>
        <li>Sufficiently optimal strength and hypertrophy results can be achieved in 3 one-hour sessions per week, but a mere 60 minutes is enough to realize significant health improvements.</li>
    </ul>
