        Define a baseline level of mobility required for you to perform at the level you want.
        Be sure to take a holistic overview, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hip, knee, ankle mobility</li>
        <li>Shoulder, elbow, wrist mobility</li>
        <li>Cervial, thoracic, lumbar spine mobility</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Establish a routine to achieve or maintain this level of mobility - daily stretching, weekly yoga, etc.</p>
    
    <p class="list-heading">Implementation (4+ weeks):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Perform 15+ minutes of yoga 3x per week for four weeks.
            Identify areas of weakness and incorporate into your longer form fitness routine to run for 2-3 months.
            Review and reassess your overall mobility approximately quarterly.
        </li>
        <li>
            This longer form routine could be the same yoga program, or it could be tailored to your individual needs
            (e.g. tight hamstrings might warrant daily static stretching along with a leg strength program).
        </li>
    </ul>
