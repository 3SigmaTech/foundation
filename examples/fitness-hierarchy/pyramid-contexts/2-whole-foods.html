    <p>Build the bulk of your diet around whole foods
        - fruits, veggies, whole meats, seafood, grains, nuts, beans/lentils, eggs, dairy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Establish a set of go-to meals created from whole foods - 1-3 each for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
        Identify choice snacking options from within whole foods - nuts, seeds, veggies, etc.
    </p>
    <p>Your goal should be to get 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight from whole sources while splitting your remaining maintenance calories between carbs and fats to your preference.</p>
    
    <p>Implementation (2+ weeks):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Eliminate empty calories - no sugary foods, no junk food (chips, fast foods, processed meats, etc.), no liquid calories (juice, soda, shakes, mochas, etc).</li>
        <li>Persist with clean eating for two full weeks. Gradually re-introduce empty calories, monitoring consumption to ensure they fit into your maintenance calories.</li>
    </ul>
