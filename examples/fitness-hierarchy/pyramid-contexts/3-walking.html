    <p>Walk 10,000 steps (3 miles, 5 kilometers, 1 hour) every day.</p>
    <p class="list-heading">Optimal times to walk are:</p>
    <ul class="tight">
        <li>Upon waking, as part of your morning routine - hitting several goals at once: morning sun, morning activity, walking.</li>
        <li>After eating a meal. A short, 10-minute walk after a meal has been shown to aid digestion and lower blood sugar.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="tight list-heading">Use this time to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Meditate: focus on your thoughts and/or emotions and strive to understand them.</li>
        <li>Goal Setting: reflect on the day and what went well and what could have gone better; consider the upcoming day and what needs to be done.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="list-heading">Implementation (3+ weeks):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Walk 1,000 more steps each day until you're averaging 10k steps per day. Continue to do so until you've averaged 10k steps for each of the last 10 days.</li>
    </ul>
