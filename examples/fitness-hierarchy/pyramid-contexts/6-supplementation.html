    <p>If you are reducing calorie intake for weight loss, you will benefit from supplementing your diet with a clean source of protein (e.g. whey isolate or fermented pea protein).</p>
    <p class="list-heading">Several other supplements offer wide-ranging, scientifically proven benefits:</p>
    <ul class="tight">
        <li>Creatine: Improves both cognitive and physical performance, target 5g per day</li>
        <li>Omega-3 Fats: Improves brain, cardiovascular, and mental health, target 1000mg of EPA+DHA per day</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="tight list-heading">Yet other supplements can be added at your discretion or generally ignored, offering little scientific benefit</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Greens Powders: Most offerings are nothing more than a multivitamin with fewer nutrients.</li>
        <li>Multivitamin: If you're concerned you're missing key nutrients in your diet: improve your diet.</li>
        <li>Hydration Mixes: Lmnt, Gatorade, etc. offer electrolytes that you likely aren't lacking.</li>
        <li>Theanine, Arginine, Citrulline, GABA, CoQ10, and others have mixed results in scientific studies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="list-heading">Implementation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement a supplement testing protocol. Add one supplement at a time to your daily routine for, e.g., 30 days then remove it for 7-14 days. Assess if you notice a material difference.</li>
        <li>Or don't; supplementation is optional, though creatine and Omega 3's are highly recommended.</li>
    </ul>
