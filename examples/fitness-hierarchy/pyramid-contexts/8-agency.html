<div class="context-body">
<p>You have established a science-based wellness routine built on effective rest patterns, clean eating, light-to-moderate activity (walking), and moderate-to-intense activity (resistance training and cardio).</p>
<p>
    You are now able to revisit your negative behavior loops (staying up late, eating junk, binge drinking) with a conscious, considered perspective.
    Engage in these activities when they bring you joy, but note when they are detrimental to baseline happiness.
</p>
<p>You are also capable of pursuing more positive behavior loops (activity-based and/or outdoor hobbies, community engagement, etc.)</p>

<p class="list-heading">Implementation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Live life. Focus on the now, with a consideration for the past and future.</li>
    <li>Review what makes you feel better: do more of these things.</li>
    <li>Review what makes you feel worse: do fewer of these things.</li>
</ul>
